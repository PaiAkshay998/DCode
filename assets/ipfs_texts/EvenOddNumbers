## Equal sum of even and odd numbers

Let's say we have an array of numbers `[5, 2, 4, 7]` and we want to check if sum(even numbers) = sum(odd numbers).

Write a function to find if the sum of even numbers matches the sum of the odd numbers in the given array

## Test Example
`Input`: `[5, 2, 4, 7]`
`Output`: `False`
